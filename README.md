## 游닇Instrucciones

Build a database model that responds to the requirements stated in the following paragraph.

> You want to design a relational database that stores information about the existing zoos in the world, as well as the animal species they house. For each zoo we know the name, city and country where it is located, size (in m2) and annual budget. For each animal species, the common name and scientific name, the family to which it belongs and whether it is in danger of extinction are stored. In addition, you should store information about each animal specimen that the zoos have, such as its identification number, species, sex, year of birth, country of origin and continent.

Once you have finished the model be sure to share the link for review.
